# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Model

This project uses machine learning to classify breast tumors as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using real diagnostic data.  
With an accuracy of over 96%, it aims to support early detection and better decision-making in healthcare.

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

The dataset contains 30 numerical features for each tumor. The data is preprocessed and used to train classification models that distinguish between malignant and benign tumors.

After training, the model can accurately predict the diagnosis based on the given features.

## ðŸ“Š Performance

The model achieves over 96% accuracy on unseen test data.  
Evaluation includes key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to ensure reliable predictions.
